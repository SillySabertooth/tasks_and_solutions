# tasks_and_solutions
This is a brief explanation of my work by itself #easy access to the scripts.</br>
I thought up this scripts during some time ago - they can significantly differ from each other by level of language and type of chosen solution.</br></br>

But, of course, i didn't spent time to adding some features like input params/files/paths from command line, handling of exceptions and standart output messages about working of script. You need to open every script by your favourite IDE (but i usually use vim),  read the body and comments, change paths_to, check programms.
