# tasks_and_solutions
This is a brief explanation of my work by itself #easy access to the scripts.</br>
I thought up this scripts during some time ago - they can significantly differ from each other by level of language and type of chosen solution.</br></br>

But, of course, i didn't spent time to adding some features like input params/files/paths from command line, handling of exceptions and standart output messages about working of script. You need to open every script by your favourite IDE (but i usually use vim),  read the body and comments, change paths_to, check programms.</br>

Most of the scripts are using for working with vcf-files or their obtaining. They can be useful to make a look on the programms and workflow. </br>

p.s. And almost all have relative paths to programms through home_dir. Cause i don't love make install - and don't like to add every new prog to PATH. But now i thought up the weird way - i make special my_dir with links to progs and add the my_dir to the PATH. (i think it's the way as make install work - by adding links to /usr/local/bin)
